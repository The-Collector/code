Alright this program will finally start to become useful.
I hope this will word wrap this stuff properly
So in order to edit to eclipse some stuff has to be edited.

include <iostream>
include <iomanip>
using namespace std;
int main()
{

	int var;
	var = 5;
	cout << var;

	return 0;
}

WELP DID THIS HELP

Ok so this could should produce the value "5".
